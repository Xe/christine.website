My Site
=======

This is intended as a portfolio site or the like.

![screenshot of the site](http://puu.sh/fqGB9/cf0bf880ae.png)

This is a site made with [lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis) and deployed on 
a server running [dokku-alt](https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt) and runs 
inside the [docker-lapis](https://github.com/Xe/docker-lapis) container.

The theming of this site is based off of Twitter's Bootstrap as well as 
a modified version of the Readable theme.
