This is a site made with [lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis) and deployed on 
a server running [dokku-alt](https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt) and runs 
inside the [docker-lapis](https://github.com/Xe/docker-lapis) container. It 
also has a copy of [OlegDB](http://olegdb.org) running to cache API requests 
from GitHub. This cache is cleared on every deploy.
